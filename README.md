# hardware-store-gui

This repository is dedicated to the graphical user interface (GUI) implementation for the hardware store system. It is an extension of the original hardware store system, leveraging object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to manage inventory, staff, scheduling, aisle numbers, and item locations.

## Features
- User-friendly interface using JavaFX
- View inventory, add staff members, update schedules, and perform various operations within the hardware store

## Development Status
Please note that this repository is currently under active development. The system is continuously improved and refined to meet the requirements of the hardware store. The core functionality of the original system remains intact, while the GUI module acts as an additional layer for user interaction. The modular design facilitates maintainability and allows for further enhancements and improvements in the future.

## Dependencies
This repository is dependent on the original hardware store system repository. For a complete and functional application, it is recommended to clone or include both repositories in your project.
